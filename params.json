  "body": "### Welcome to [Art of Circuits](http://artofcircuits.com) **artobot**\r\nArtoBot is currently designed around Arduino Mega 2560 but other Boards such as Arduino Uno, Arduino Leonardo, Arduino DUE, Arduino Pro mini, Arduino Pro Micro, or Any Arduino Board which full fills the IO requirements can be used (with minor modifications to orignal scheme).  ArtoBot uses HC-06 Bluetooth Module. Any Bluetooth capable Android phone can be used to control ArtoBot using a free [Remote Control App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller) from google play store. \r\n\r\nArtoBot Application code written for Arduino IDE can be customized to work with other Bluetooth Remote Apps.\r\n\r\nFollowing Two chassis were used as reference for development of artobot\r\n\r\n[2 wheel drive chassis] (http://artofcircuits.com/product/2-wheel-drive-plastic-chassis-zc2)\r\n[4 wheel drive chassis] (http://artofcircuits.com/product/4wheel-drive-plastic-chassis-un-assembled)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nArt of Circuits (@artofcircuits) - Author\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
