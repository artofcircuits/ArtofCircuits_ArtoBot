# ArtofCircuits_ArtoBot
ArtoBot is a set of example Arduino codes for 2 wheel drive and 4 wheel drive experimental robots. ArtoBot can be a good starting point for experimenters, and makers those who are interested in making their DIY 2-wheel or 4-wheel robot.


**Hardware**
ArtoBot is currently designed around Arduino Mega 2560 but other Arduino boards can be used as well if they fullfil the IO requirements.
ArtoBot uses [HC-06 Bluetooth Module](http://artofcircuits.com/product/hc-06-bluetooth-serial-pass-through-module). Any Bluetooth capable Android phone can be used to control ArtoBot using a free [Remote Control App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller) from google play store. ArtoBot Application code written for Arduino IDE can be customized to work with other Bluetooth Remote Apps. 


**Example of Robot Chassis that can be used**

[2-wheel drive chassis] (http://artofcircuits.com/product/2-wheel-drive-plastic-chassis-zc2)

[4-wheel drive chassis] (http://artofcircuits.com/product/4wheel-drive-plastic-chassis-un-assembled)

Any other 2-wheel drive or 4 wheel drive chassis can be used to build your artobot.
